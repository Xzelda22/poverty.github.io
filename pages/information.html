            In the early 1960s, the world saw Myanmar as one of the most prosperous nations in South Asia due to its abundance of natural resources. However, in 1962, a coup d’état that established a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party pushed children’s rights aside. Unsurprisingly, fundamental rights are not equally shared across Myanmar’s socioeconomic makeup. A high poverty rate is accompanied by high child mortality. As of 2019, the mortality rate for children under 5 was 44.7 per 1,000 live births compared to 5.6 deaths per 1,000 births in the United States. Additionally, the exact number of children born is unknown as around 65% of births are not officially reported due to midwives only registering rural births informally. The Myanmar government does not allocate sufficient funds to education and many families cannot afford to send their children to school. Consequently, around 3% of children in Myanmar have had no education and an estimated 8.6 million people older than 15 are illiterate. Without education or basic literacy skills, it is virtually impossible to find a high-paying job outside of factory or construction work.

        Main problems that children have to face in Myanmar is poverty. Myanmar suffers from structural poverty.  32 % of the population lives below the poverty line.  For example, the Gross National Product (GIP) per inhabitant is $1,246.This sort of poverty prevents children from enjoying their most fundamental rights.  Children from rural areas are especially hard hit. Lack of equipment and competent personnel has a considerable effect on the health of children, particularly those  from poor families.  In effect, around 70 ‰ of Myanmar’s children die before the age of 5. Other alarming health indicators include such things as dietary deficiencies (often present from birth) and AIDS (often passed from mother to infant); it is estimated that numerous children suffer from these two problems. Suffice it to say that, in order to improve the living conditions of children, the risk of mother-to-child HIV infection needs to be eradicated. Education and instruction is free and obligatory up to the age of 10 — which is well short of the international average.
