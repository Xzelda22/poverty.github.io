            "The 2015–17 period was a ‘moderately high-growth’ period, and our results reflect that. The subsequent Covid-19 pandemic and the February 2021 coup have undoubtedly undone much of the prior progress and influenced the profiles of poverty and vulnerability transitions. We do not account explicitly for these two events in the following discussion due to lack of data, though we include some concluding considerations at the end of the post about their impact."

        <p>At national level, we estimated that for people, who were poor in 2015, there was a respectable probability (about 40%) of exiting poverty in 2017. Moreover, for non-poor individuals in 2015 the risk of becoming poor in 2017 was only about 6%. We furthermore established that people in a vulnerable situation were relatively more likely to become non-vulnerable than to enter poverty (50% versus 15%). All of these indicators signalled progress, though the probability of remaining in a vulnerable situation was non-negligible at national level (about 35%).</p>

            The Myanmar government does not allocate sufficient funds to education and many families cannot afford to send their children to school. Consequently, around 3% of children in Myanmar have had no education and an estimated 8.6 million people older than 15 are illiterate. Without education or basic literacy skills, it is virtually impossible to find a high-paying job outside of factory or construction work.

            In Myanmar, the poverty trap forces 1.1 million children aged 5-17 into dangerous working conditions. Unable to participate in both school and the formal workforce, these children find themselves stuck in an inescapable cycle of generational poverty. They work as porters, cleaners, cooks, field laborers and more, either due to coercion by the Burma National Armed Forces or to help supplement their household income. Some employers are quick to exploit an influx of undereducated child workers who are unaware of the health and workers’ rights violations they face. The standard workweek in the United States is typically 40 hours, but a quarter of child workers in Myanmar aged 12-17 typically face workweeks of 60 hours or more. Most child labor takes place in rural areas and a minimum of 197 children work in dangerous conflict-ridden areas such as Kachin, Rakhine and Shan due to coercion.

        Health issues can be seen across the poverty profile. Poor health is the single most common shock to welfare reported by households. Health expenditures are high and almost exclusively out-of-pocket, and the number of days of labor lost is significant, placing a large burden on households.
        Child poverty and vulnerability in Myanmar explains
        that until COVID-19 hit Myanmar and the world, Myanmar
        was on a path of consistent reduction of household poverty,
        which had contributed to lift millions of people out of
        poverty in recent years
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In addition to these five million children, a further
        approximately six million children (34%) live in
        vulnerable households or households where consumption is
        only slightly above the national poverty line. Any shock could
        make these vulnerable households fall into poverty4. Like
        many other countries, Myanmar is implementing measures
        to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the
        socio-economic effects of these measures and the resulting
        economic slowdown may have life-long negative impacts
        on children and delay Myanmar’s achievement of the
        Sustainable Development Goals.
